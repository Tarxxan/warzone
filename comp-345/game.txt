Map is defined by a user in a text file
	- We have to read the file and transform it into graph (probably into Map object)

- Map consists of continents
	- continents consist of countries
	- if a continent is owned by a player, player has bonus army to place on it
		- countries are owned by one player 
		- it has 1 or more solder (army)

Game:
	- User choses number of players
		- Countries are randomly assigned to users
	** Game starts **
	- Each user is given a turn
		- User is given army (# of territories / 3 round down)+bonus from continent *minimum 3*
		- 3 types of actions are given:
			- Deployment: set army on their territory (increment army on a country node)
			- Advance order: move army from one territory to another
				- if target territory is his then: decrease counter of source, increment the counter of destination
				- if its someone else, attack happends:
					- The invader chooses how much army to use and has a 60% chance of destroying one army unit
					- The defender has 70% chance of destroying one attacking unit
					- If defenders army completely destroyed, it is now owned by the atakcer with survivors on the territory
					- If user succesfully conquered a territory, we should set the flag for giving special cards to True
			- Special cards
				- Bomb: destroys half of the army (make sure the territory is adjacent to the players territory)
				- Blockade: triple the number of armies on one of the current playerâ€™s territories and make it a neutral territory
				- Airlift: same as advance but doesnt have to be adjacent
				- Negotiate: no attacks between curent player and someone else
				- Reinforcement: 5 extra solders
		- Once the user specified all his actions, he sets ready
		- If the user has conquered at least 1 territory he gets a special card
	- Once everyone is set ready - execution of orders begins
	- If a user doesnt own a territory - he is eliminated
	- game ends when a user owns all the territories (or i guess when noone left)
